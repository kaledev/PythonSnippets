    "This is a rather simple example of how to perform a Sentiment Analysis utilizing the NLTK library, and the pre-trained VADER model. The advantage of this model is that it is very simple and saves you from needing to perform train/test splits and fitting models yourself. However, VADER isn't the best in every situation as it may not perform well against all text (in which case a custom model may be better).\n",
